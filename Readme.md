# Short Description 2

Encrypt and decrypt text securely with AES-256. Minimal app, open-source, offline, no ads, no tracking. Everything happens locally on your device — no data ever leaves it.

🌟 Key advantages:

⚙️ Offline operation — no permissions, no accounts, no ads, no analytics — your data stays private.

🕶️ Privacy-first design — low-contrast black theme helps protect from shoulder-surfing, camera, or CCTV recording.

🔁 Secure password rotation — change your password safely without copying or pasting secrets.

🚫 Clipboard protection — decrypted text cannot be copied, reducing exposure to clipboard-sniffing malware.

🔐 Strong password enforcement — only passwords meeting strict security requirements (length ≥ 16, mix of upper/lowercase, numbers and symbols) are accepted.

🧩 Open and verifiable — the full source code is tiny and easy to review on GitHub (coming soon):
